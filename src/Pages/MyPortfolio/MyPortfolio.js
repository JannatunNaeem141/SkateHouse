                                Hi! My name is Naeem. I am a full stack web developer, looking to enhance my professional experience. I'm skilled with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB etc.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My strength are being hard-working, easily adaptable to any kind of environment, and being hard-working, honest. Punctuate, self-motivated and team worker. But my weakness is I am not comfortable until I finished my work in the given time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company in which I can grow my working skills and get more and more knowledge and gain financial independence. Besides my long-term goal is to become a more responsible and knowledgeable personality.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night. And to mention that coding is my all-time favorite.
